This is the repository for the LiveEdu.tv Premium stream "How to Build a Blockchain Explorer with Javascript"

It's separated into 2 projects, client and server.

Clone the repo and go into each folder `server` and `client` and do an `npm i` to download the npm modules required.

You also need nodemon so be sure to run `npm i -g nodemon` if you haven't already.
